          Street Hockey Of Wharton (the SHOW) is played on foot with a tennis ball—think "the pickleball of hockey": easy to pick up, safe, and should not be taken too seriously (yet here we are). All equipment is provided. All Penn Grad School students and their partners are welcome to play - free of charge!
