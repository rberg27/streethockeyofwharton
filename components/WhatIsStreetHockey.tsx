            Street Hockey is played on foot with a tennis ball. Think of it as the pickleball of hockey: easy to pick up, safe, and should not be taken too seriously (yet here we are). All equipment is provided. All Penn Grad School students and their partners are welcome to play, free of charge!

            If you've ever read LinkedIn, you would know that everything in life is sales. SHOW is your opportunity to hone your skill of salesmanship to convince your peers to join! We are Penn's premier multi-level marketing scheme - but instead of committing fraud, we're having a blast playing street hockey at Street Hockey Night in America once a quarter.
